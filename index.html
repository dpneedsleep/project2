            <p>One of Italy’s favourite scooters – with nearly 11,500 units sold in 2018 – is practically a brand-new machine for 2020. Sleek, restyled bodywork and a redesigned frame bring over 50% more storage space; revised rear geometry makes for a more comfortable ride. The new four-valve engine accelerates faster, is quicker at the top-end and returns greater fuel efficiency. It’s also EURO5 compliant and Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) is now a standard fit.
	</p>

            <p> The engine is a Euro5-compliant 124.5cc liquid-cooled four-valve eSP+ engine, which comes equipped with a fuel-saving ‘stop-start’ system, as well as Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC), which helps prevent rear wheel slip in poor conditions.

		  As a small family run business, sentimentality and heritage are at the heart of what we practise at NMJ, and these elements are echoed in the tradition of the signet ring.

As precious and distinctly unique pieces, they can become an integral part of your individual story, as well as a point of connectiontoyour family and those close to you.

We sat down with Daniel Fitch, and his Dad, Simon, to learn more about the history of signet rings, what heirloom jewellery means to them and the significance of their family crest.

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">The 12th Mini </span><p><span class="headline hl4">It's wasn't a dream</span></p></div><p>“How did they make it that small!?”

That’s invariably the reaction of friends and family when I show them the iPhone 12 mini. They can’t process how tiny this 5.4-inch device is; they didn’t know smartphones could be this small anymore.</p>
          <img class="media" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.entertainmentbox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-iPhone-12-mini-charges-20-slower-than-other-models.gif?w=696&ssl=1" alt="">

					<p>I recommend the more expensive iPhones like 12 and 12 Pro in in the lineup shortly after launch, and for customers with specific needs only met by those models. iPhone SE and iPhone XR are easy recommendations for budget-minded buyers. For me, iPhone 12 mini is my go-to recommendation for mid-cycle customers without specific needs that pricier models fulfill – especially in the six-month period before the iPhone 13 launches. </p></div>
